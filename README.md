- I opted to use Vite, rather than creat-react-app as this is what I am used to using
- I chose to bring all the show data into the local state due to the unknowns of what else this state could be used for as part of a larger application.
- The loading and error messages could have nicer UI, however I didn't want to spend too long on these features
- I would have preferred to spent longer on the CSS if time allowed it.
